Here's a neat little trick:

You can use the `clamp()` CSS function to make `font-size` responsive and fluid!

It works by "clamping", or restricting, a flexible value between a minimum and a maximum range.

Here's how to use it:

1. Choose a minimum value: E.g. `16px`
2. Choose a maximum value: E.g. `34px`
3. Choose a flexible value: E.g. `5vw`

```css
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(16px, 5vw, 34px);
}
```

In this example, the `h1` `font-size` value will be `5%` of the viewport width. But only if that value is bigger than `16px` and smaller than `34px`.

For instance, if your viewport width is `300px`, your `5vw` value will be equal to `15px`. However, you clamped that `font-size` value to a minimum of `16px`, so that is what is going to be.

On the other hand, if your viewport width is `1400px`, you `5vw` will be a whooping `70px`! But luckily you clamped that maximum value to `34px`, so it won't grow past that.

Oh, and it also works with padding! And margin!

And literally any other property that accepts a [length, frequency, angle, time, percentage, number, or integer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp)!

[Browser support](https://caniuse.com/css-math-functions) is also pretty good if you don't need to support IE/older Safari versions, look:

I _love_ modern CSS. What are your thoughts on `clamp()`?

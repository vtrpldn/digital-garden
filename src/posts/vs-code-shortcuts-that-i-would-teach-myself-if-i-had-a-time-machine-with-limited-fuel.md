â€” "Hey, it's me. Listen up, I don't have much time."

â€” "Wait, what?! What is happening?! Who are-How did you get in my house?! Wh-why do you look so much like me?!"

â€” "I _am_ you, you dum-dum. I came from the future _specially_ to teach you some VS Code shortcuts. Now..."

â€” "Wait. Are you _serious_? You could've brought back lottery results, stock market data, but you came all the way here to teach me freaking VS Code shortcuts?!"

â€” "Listen, I really don't have much juice left on this thing... Just sit and pay attention please, this is impor..."

â€” "Couldn't you have written these shortcuts, you know, on a piece of paper?"

â€” "Shut up! This is important!"

â€” "Okay, okay..."

â€” "So, you should **stop clicking for files** in File Explorer and **start using Command/Ctrl+P**, then type the file name. Add :N and it will open exactly at that line number"

â€” "Ooooh, we have hologram gifs in the future, nice example"

â€” "I know, _right_? Also, **stop navigating the File Explorer with your mouse** altogether and just **use Command/Ctrl+Shift+E and arrow keys**, ok?"

â€” "Ok, cool..."

â€” "Now, if you ever need to **focus on the panel again**, instead of clicking the edit area, just **press Command/Ctrl+1** and it will focus the first open panel"

â€” "Cool, cool cool cool cool cool no doubt"

â€” "**Use Command+Shift+[ and ] to navigate** through file tabs, try **Alt+Left and Right** if you run Windows in this timeline. This will save you a lot of time"

â€” "Hard to think of it as _a lot_ of time but, yeah, okayâ€¦ You're the one with the _time_ machine"

â€” "Use **Command/Ctrl+B to toggle the editor sidebar**, it will **save you some space** when coding on small screens"

![Example gif](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/8x29w73g654lo5omhzz5.gif)

â€” "I knew that one!"

â€” "Instead of scrolling so much, **use Control/Ctrl+G to go straight to the line you want**, do you copy?"

![Example gif](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/287qjeujlzkprorqrw0l.gif)

â€” "Roger that"

â€” "**Use Command/Ctrl+Shift+L** whenever you need to _select all occurrences_ of some text

![Example gif](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/0t3jb9x2bfna6s47g1s7.gif)

â€” "Handy! Next one please."

â€” "**Command/Ctrl+W closes** the current tab, **Command/Ctrl+Shift+T reopens** it"

â€” "The usual, nothing new he..."

![Example gif](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/rjao669s54wmblxnv9ec.gif)

â€” "Wait, I have to return now. **Command/Ctrl+Shift+H is Find & Replace**, you'll always forget this one, don't be too hard on yourself"

![Example gif](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/bpzaslxon2eoyaoctply.gif)

"Wait! I have _so many questions_! How did I even get a time machine? Does _this_ creates a new parallel universe? Will 49ers ever win the Super Bowl again? Hey, wait! Waaait."

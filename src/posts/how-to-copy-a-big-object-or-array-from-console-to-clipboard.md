Have you ever found yourself trying to `Ctrl-C` a `console.log()` output, only to get mad when it doesn't really work with long Objects and Arrays?

## Here's what you should do instead:

1 - Right-click the `console.log()` output
2 - Click "Store as global variable"
3 - Run `copy(temp1)`
4 - `Ctrl-V` it wherever you want

Success! You may find that useful when debugging complex data structures or request payloads.

Let me know in the comments what else `copy()` might be useful for! ðŸ˜„

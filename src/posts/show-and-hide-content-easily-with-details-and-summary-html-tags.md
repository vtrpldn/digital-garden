Here's a neat little trick:

You can use the `<details>` and `<summary>` HTML tags to create a simple accordion/collapsible UI.

![Summary/Details tags example](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/fnfv4dzovmj7smzx50vr.gif)

The only problem here is that it looks rather plain and uninteresting.

But nothing that a few lines of CSS can't fix! Here's how it looks with just a little bit of styling.

codesandboxEmbed pel2y view=preview module=/index.html

Remember that you can click the "Open Sandbox" button and edit the styles yourself. I'm sure that you can make it look even nicer. üòÑ

Oh, and here's the CSS, take a look. It features a couple hacks with `padding` and `box-shadow` to make the "border" look consistent but, other than that, it is a pretty simple change.

```css
/* The --padding variable help us control
the <details> and <summary> spacing */
:root {
  --padding: 16px;
}

details {
  padding: 0 var(--padding);
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 4px;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
details[open] {
  padding-bottom: var(--padding);
}

details > summary {
  display: flex;
  padding: var(--padding);
  margin: 0 calc(var(--padding) * -1);
  border-radius: 4px;
  font-size: 24px;
  cursor: pointer;
  justify-content: space-between;
  list-style: none; /* Hides the default arrow */
}
details[open] > summary {
  box-shadow: 0 4px;
}
/* Adds an icon when the <details> is closed... */
details > summary::after {
  content: "+";
}
/* ...and switches it when <details> is open */
details[open] > summary::after {
  content: "-";
}
/* Removes the ugly default arrow on Chrome */
details > summary::-webkit-details-marker {
  display: none;
}
```

I love how much you can accomplish with plain HTML and CSS.

And by using standard HTML tags you get great accessibility for free!

## But wait, there's more!

You can go even further and transform these two tags into a powerful and, dare I say, [_extremely reusable_](https://dev.to/vtrpldn/series/8380) component.

## Let's add some React to it! ‚öõÔ∏è

These two tags work very well with React's component composition pattern.

So you can just go ahead and create a component to help you toggle stuff more consistently and easier.

Look:

codesandboxEmbed 3fjee view=editor module=/src/Collapsible.js

Then you can import that component and use it like so:

codesandboxEmbed 3fjee view=split module=/src/App.js

This is a great component to have on your toolbelt for when you need to implement a few accordions quickly.

You know how artists and bands are influenced by other great people? I believe the same applies to our careers.

I'm sure that I wouldn't be nowhere *near* where I am in my career if it wasn't for the influence of excellent professionals, near or far. And I'm not talking code exclusively, there is BIG value in looking up to professionals that are kind, committed, and have great work ethic.

But enough with lengthy intros, here's a list of people whose work might positively influence your career. 

Oh, and this is a randomized list so no such thing as ranking here.
